# SIT210_PCB_Files

These are EAGLE files.
I keep thinking "Maybe EAGLE will be better this time" and every time it disappoints and is somehow worse.

# NOTE
I realise the board I am connecting to doesn't actually need the voltage divider. But when I realised that, I left it in because it is just too simple and boring otherwise.
I am going to upload a version without it which should work fine too.
